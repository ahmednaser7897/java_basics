===============================================================================
         INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE (ISP) - BEFORE
===============================================================================

Definition
----------
Clients should not be forced to depend on methods
they do not use.

Idea
----
A class should only implement methods it actually needs.

In this example, we created one large interface
that contains every possible worker action.

This forces some classes to implement
methods that don't make sense.

This violates ISP.

 * Worker Interface

 * Answer:
