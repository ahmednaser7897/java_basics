            LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE (LSP) - AFTER
===============================================================================

Definition
----------
Objects of a subclass should be replaceable with objects
of the parent class without changing the correctness of the program.

Idea
----
The problem wasn't Penguin.

The problem was our design.

We assumed that every Bird can fly,
which is not true.

The solution is to separate birds into:

1- Bird         -> Common behavior.
2- FlyingBird   -> Birds that can fly.

Now only birds that actually fly inherit fly().

Benefits
--------
✔ Correct inheritance.
✔ No fake implementations.
✔ No runtime exceptions.
✔ Easy to extend.

 * WHY IS THIS BETTER?
 * =============================================================================
 * ==
 * 
 * Old Design
 * 
 * Bird
 * ├── Sparrow ✔
 * └── Penguin ❌
 * 
 * Problem:
 * 
 * Bird promised that every bird can fly.
 * 
 * Penguin broke that promise.
 * 
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * --
 * 
 * New Design
 * 
 * Bird
 * ├── FlyingBird
 * │ └── Sparrow
 * │
 * └── Penguin
 * 
 * Now:
 * 
 * ✔ Sparrow can replace FlyingBird.
 * 
 * ✔ Penguin can replace Bird.
 * 
 * No broken behavior.
 * 
 * No runtime exceptions.
 * 
 * =============================================================================
 * ==
 * 
 * Real Life Example
 * 
 * Vehicle
 * |
 * |---- Car
 * |
 * |---- Bicycle
 * 
 * Imagine Vehicle has:
 * 
 * startEngine()
 * 
 * Bicycle doesn't have an engine.
 * 
 * Wrong design.
 * 
 * Better:
 * 
 * Vehicle
 * 
 * MotorVehicle extends Vehicle
 * 
 * Car extends MotorVehicle
 * 
 * Bike extends Vehicle
 * 
 * Same idea as Bird/FlyingBird.
 * 
 * =============================================================================
 * ==
 * 
 * Interview Question
 * 
 * Q:
 * Why is this design following LSP?
 * 
 * Answer:
 * 
 * Because every subclass fulfills the behavior
 * promised by its parent.
 * 
 * FlyingBird objects can always fly.
 * 
 * Bird objects are not forced to fly.
 * 
 * No subclass breaks the parent's contract.
